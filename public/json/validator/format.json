  "description": "The format keyword allows for basic semantic identification of certain kinds of string values that are commonly used. For example, because JSON doesn’t have a “DateTime” type, dates need to be encoded as strings. format allows the schema author to indicate that the string value should be interpreted as a date. By default, format is just an annotation and does not effect validation.",
